## Overview

This repository is managed as an [Nx](https://nx.dev/) monorepo. It contains the entire frontend platform for the DEX, including the main Next.js application and shared libraries.

The architecture is built on a strong separation of concerns, featuring:

- **A Hybrid API Layer:** Using oRPC for application data and gRPC for high-performance blockchain operations.
- **Layered State Management:** A clear hierarchy using TanStack Query for server state, TanStack Form for forms, and XState for complex workflows.
- **Library-First Structure:** Code is organized into modular, reusable libraries with stable APIs.

## Architectural Principles

To contribute effectively, you must understand and respect these core principles.

### 1. API: Use the Right Tool for the Job

- **oRPC (Application Data):** Use the oRPC client via TanStack Query hooks for fetching data like token lists, pool info, etc. It's optimized for batching and caching.
- **gRPC (Blockchain Actions):** Use the gRPC client for executing transactions, trades, or liquidity operations. It's built for high-performance, critical actions.

### 2. State Management: A Clear Hierarchy

- **TanStack Query:** Manages **all** server state. Never use `useState`/`useEffect` for data fetching.
- **TanStack Form:** Manages **all** form state and validation.
- **XState:** Reserved **exclusively** for complex, multi-step user flows that can be modeled as a state machine (e.g., a transaction lifecycle).

### 3. Monorepo: Think in Libraries

- All shared logic, UI components, and utilities **must** reside in a `libs/` library.
- The `apps/web` project should primarily compose features from these libraries.
- Respect library boundaries by only importing from a library's public API (`index.ts`).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed **on your local machine**:

- **Node.js:** `v24.0.0` or higher (use `nvm` or `asdf`).
- **pnpm:** `v10.12.4`.
- **Git**

## Quick Start ðŸš€

1.  **Clone and install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/darklakefi/dex-web.git](https://github.com/darklakefi/dex-web.git)
    cd dex-web
    pnpm install
    ```
2.  **Start the development server:**
    ```sh
    pnpm start
    ```
    The application will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Development Workflow

- **Start dev server:** `pnpm start`
- **Build the app:** `pnpm build`
- **Run tests:** `pnpm test`
- **Format code:** `pnpm format`
- **View dependency graph:** `pnpm dep-graph`

## Conventional Commits

We use the Conventional Commits specification. This is enforced by our CI.

## Signed Commits

All commits to this repository must be signed. Unsigned commits will be rejected by CI. Please follow the instructions in the DEVELOPMENT.md to set up GPG key signing.

## CircleCI

See CIRCLECI.md for full details on our CI/CD pipeline.

## Knip: Unused Code & Dependency Checker

Knip helps keep the repository clean by finding unused files, exports, and dependencies.

```bash
pnpm knip
```

Run this before submitting a PR to help keep the codebase tidy.
